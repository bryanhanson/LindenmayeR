Title: Functions to Explore L-Systems (Lindenmayer Systems)
Version: 0.1-2
Date: 2014-12-10
Description: Lindenmayer or L-systems are parallel rewriting systems which can
    be used to simulate biological forms and certain kinds of fractals.
    Briefly, in an L-system a series of symbols in a string are replaced
    iteratively according to rules to give a more complex string. Eventually,
    the symbols are translated into turtle graphics for plotting. Wikipedia has
    a very good introduction: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system This package
    provides basic functions for exploring L-systems.
